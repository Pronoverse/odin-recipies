    <p>I came up with this white spaghetti sauce recipe one night to serve with dried pasta and spicy battered shrimp.</p>
    <p>My husband lived in Italy for three years, so he's really picky about his Italian cuisine.</p>
    <p>He loved this sauce and thought I spent all day on dinner.</p>
    <p>It is really hard to mess up this kind of white sauce.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, it's similar to Alfredo sauce but without cheese.</p>
